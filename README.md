# DigitRush - Fast-Paced Math Challenge Game

DigitRush is an adrenaline-pumping math quiz game built on Reddit's Devvit platform that challenges players to solve arithmetic problems under intense time pressure. Race against a 30-second countdown timer while tackling addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems to achieve the highest score possible.

## What is DigitRush?

DigitRush is a high-intensity mental math game that transforms arithmetic practice into an exciting competitive experience. Players face a continuous stream of randomly generated math problems across four operation types with only 30 seconds to solve as many as possible. The game features:

- **Real-time 30-second gameplay** with dynamic countdown timer and visual progress bar
- **Four math operation types**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with balanced difficulty
- **Instant visual feedback** with color-coded responses (green for correct, red for incorrect)
- **Community leaderboards** with medal system (ü•áü•àü•â) for competitive play
