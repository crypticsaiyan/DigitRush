## What is DigitRush?

DigitRush is an interactive mental math gaming platform that runs directly within Reddit posts. Players can choose between two distinct game modes: a high-speed 60-second Speed Challenge for rapid-fire problem solving, or a precision-focused Daily Challenge where everyone gets the same 5 problems each day. All gameplay features real-time leaderboards with Reddit user integration, persistent progress tracking, and seamless social sharing capabilities.

The game launches directly from Reddit posts with a single click, requiring no downloads or external accounts. Players see their Reddit username and Snoo avatar throughout the experience, creating a truly native Reddit gaming experience that feels like a natural extension of the platform.

### Problem Types & Difficulty

DigitRush generates four types of arithmetic problems with carefully balanced difficulty for optimal mental math challenge:

| Operation | Format | Number Range | Example Problems | Mental Math Level |
|-----------|--------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Addition** | `A + B = ?` | 10-99 + 10-99 | `47 + 83 = 130` | Moderate |
| **Subtraction** | `A - B = ?` | 20-99 - 10 to (A-1) | `74 - 29 = 45` | Moderate |
| **Multiplication** | `A Ã— B = ?` | 2-20 Ã— 2-10 | `7 Ã— 8 = 56` | Moderate-Hard |
| **Division** | `A Ã· B = ?` | Clean division, divisors 2-11 | `84 Ã· 7 = 12` | Moderate-Hard |

**Problem Generation Logic:**
- **Addition/Subtraction**: Two-digit numbers ensuring reasonable mental math difficulty
- **Multiplication**: Avoids single digits (except as multipliers) to prevent trivial problems
- **Division**: Guarantees whole number results by generating dividend as divisor Ã— answer
- **Daily Challenge**: Uses deterministic seeding based on date for global consistency

### Configuration
Easily customize game parameters:

```typescript
// src/shared/constants.ts
export const GAME_DURATION_SECONDS = 60;              // Speed Challenge duration
export const LOW_TIME_THRESHOLD = 10;                 // Warning threshold (red progress bar)
export const DAILY_CHALLENGE_PROBLEMS_COUNT = 5;      // Daily Challenge problem count
export const ALLOW_DAILY_RETRIES_FOR_TESTING = false; // Enable replay for development
```

### Commands
```bash
npm run dev        # Development server with hot reloading
npm run build      # Build for production
