## What is DigitRush?

DigitRush is a mental math gaming platform that runs directly within Reddit posts, in which players can choose between speed challenges or daily competitions, all while competing with real Reddit users on global leaderboards.

### Two Exciting Game Modes

#### **Speed Challenge**
The classic DigitRush experience - an intense 60-second mental math challenge.

#### **Daily Challenge**
Every day brings a new set of 5 carefully crafted problems that all players worldwide attempt to solve as quickly and accurately as possible.

### Reddit-Native Integration
Built exclusively for Reddit's Devvit platform with seamless user integration:
- **Zero Downloads**: Runs directly in Reddit posts - no external apps required
- **Authentic Competition**: Dual leaderboards with real Reddit usernames and avatars
- **Social Sharing**: Native mobile share API with intelligent clipboard fallback for desktop
- **Cross-Subreddit**: Players from different communities compete on unified global leaderboards
- **Persistent Progress**: High scores and daily challenge completions saved across sessions with Redis backend

### ðŸ§® Math Problem Types

DigitRush generates four types of arithmetic problems with carefully balanced difficulty:

| Operation | Format | Range | Examples | Difficulty |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Addition** | `A + B = ?` | 10-99 + 10-99 | `47 + 83`, `25 + 56` | Moderate |
| **Subtraction** | `A - B = ?` | 20-99 - 10 to (A-1) | `74 - 29`, `85 - 47` | Moderate |
| **Multiplication** | `A Ã— B = ?` | 2-20 Ã— 2-10 | `7 Ã— 8`, `15 Ã— 6` | Moderate-Hard |
| **Division** | `A Ã· B = ?` | Clean division, divisors 2-11 | `84 Ã· 7`, `132 Ã· 11` | Moderate-Hard |

export const DAILY_CHALLENGE_PROBLEMS_COUNT = 5;      // Daily Challenge problem count
export const ALLOW_DAILY_RETRIES_FOR_TESTING = false; // Enable replay for development
```

### Commands
