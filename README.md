## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+ (required for Devvit compatibility)
- Reddit account connected to Reddit developers

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Game Configuration

**Note for Developers**: The game is currently configured with a **10-second duration** for intense gameplay. This setting is defined in `src/shared/constants.ts`:

```typescript
export const GAME_DURATION_SECONDS = 10;
export const GAME_DURATION_MS = GAME_DURATION_SECONDS * 1000;
export const LOW_TIME_THRESHOLD = 10; // Warning threshold for red timer
```

To adjust the game duration for different difficulty levels, simply modify the `GAME_DURATION_SECONDS` constant. Common configurations:
- **5 seconds**: Ultra-extreme challenge
- **10 seconds**: Intense challenge (current setting)
- **30 seconds**: Standard challenge
- **60 seconds**: Extended challenge

The `LOW_TIME_THRESHOLD` constant controls when the timer turns red to warn players of low time remaining.
