## What is DigitRush?

DigitRush is a comprehensive mental math gaming platform that runs directly within Reddit posts, featuring two distinct game modes that test your mathematical skills in different ways. Players can choose between lightning-fast speed challenges or strategic daily competitions, all while competing with real Reddit users on global leaderboards.

The game features a sophisticated dual-mode architecture where each mode offers a completely different gameplay experience: Speed Challenge focuses on rapid-fire problem solving under extreme time pressure, while Daily Challenge emphasizes strategic precision with a single daily attempt at 5 carefully crafted problems.

### Two Exciting Game Modes

#### üöÄ **Speed Challenge** (60-Second Rush)
The classic DigitRush experience - an intense 60-second mental math challenge that tests your speed and accuracy under extreme time pressure. Race to solve as many arithmetic problems as possible while a countdown timer creates heart-pounding urgency.

- **60-Second Timer**: Solve as many math problems as possible in exactly 60 seconds
- **Revolutionary Auto-Submit**: Correct answers instantly advance to the next problem - no button pressing required
- **Manual Mode Option**: Toggle auto-submit off for more deliberate gameplay with Enter key submission
- **Unlimited Attempts**: Play as many rounds as you want to improve your high score
- **Real-Time Scoring**: Watch your score climb with each correct answer (1 point per correct problem)
- **Performance Analytics**: View problems per minute rate and accuracy percentage after each game

#### üèÜ **Daily Challenge** (Strategic Precision)
A completely different experience focused on accuracy and speed optimization. Every day brings a new set of 5 carefully crafted problems that all players worldwide attempt to solve as quickly and accurately as possible.

- **5 Fixed Problems**: Same 5 math problems for all players worldwide each day (deterministically generated)
- **One Attempt Only**: Single chance per day creates strategic pressure and eliminates grinding
- **Speed-Based Ranking**: Among players with equal scores, fastest completion time determines ranking
- **Perfect Score Priority**: Players with 5/5 correct compete separately from those with lower scores
- **Precision Timing**: Completion time tracked to tenths of seconds for accurate leaderboard ranking
- **Global Daily Leaderboard**: Compete against players from all Reddit communities with daily reset

### Core Gameplay Features
- **Four Operation Types**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with balanced difficulty ranges
- **Dual Scoring Systems**: Speed Challenge = 1 point per correct answer; Daily Challenge = completion time ranking
